# Landing Page GoL

A basic (yet pretty) Portfolio/Landing page written in React. It features some neat styling, and a dynamic Game of Life simulation as the background. Excessive, but cute!

## How to Use
```shell
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```
Make sure to have a recent version of Node installed.

## Configuration
You can configure most of the page from the [configuration file](src/config.js), including simulation parameters, static strings, etc. If you're making the page your own, you'd want to update the files on `public` too.

## TODO
1. Add some basic testing.
2. Research GoL implementation performance a bit more in depth.
